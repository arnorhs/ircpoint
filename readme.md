### Not currently working

### Wat

Will be a persistent IRC client kind of a thing, which adds extra features on top of IRC

- You don't have to be online all the time, you just log in to the client
- Extra features added on top of IRC which are available to users of the client, but maybe and maybe not to IRC users
- Probably using shoe or some kind of a websockets thing for the client-server stuff
